If you want to add new feature you can either make an issue and mark it as feature request:  
https://github.com/networkinss/joaswizard/issues  
Just start the title with "Featurerequest: <newfeature>"  
or raise a bug starting the title with: "Bug: <bugtitle>".

For PRs you should fork the project, make the changes, and create a PR from the fork.
